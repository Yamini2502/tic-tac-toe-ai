Comparing AI agents for tic-tac-toe using: Minimax, Alpha-Beta Pruning, and Q-Learning
This project demonstrates AI strategies for playing Tic Tac Toe:
1. **Minimax Algorithm**: Provides optimal decisions using exhaustive search.
2. **Alpha-Beta Pruning**: Optimizes Minimax by reducing unnecessary calculations.
3. **Q-Learning**: Uses reinforcement learning to adapt and improve performance.
Players can compete against the AI and explore the strengths of each approach.

## Features
- Human vs AI gameplay.
- Three AI implementations:
  - Minimax Algorithm
  - Alpha-Beta Pruning
  - Q-Learning
- Performance tracking for execution time and memory usage.
- Q-Learning learning curve visualization.

## Running the Game
- To play with Minimax AI: python minimax.py
- To play with Alpha-Beta AI: python Alpha_beta.py
- To run and analyze Q-Learning: python q_learning.py

## Performance
This project tracks:
- **Execution Time**: Measures time taken by AI moves.
- **Memory Usage**: Tracks memory consumption during execution.
- **Q-Learning Metrics**:
  - Learning curves.
  - Game outcomes (win/loss/draw rates).
Graphs are generated for Q-Learning progress.
